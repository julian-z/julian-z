# ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I am Julian Zulfikar, a Computer Science student at UC Irvine.

I love everything revolving around computer science and technology in general. As an aspiring Software Engineer, my main driving factor is the idea of being able to create programs that will be utilized by others, especially ones that will assist in solving problems.

## ðŸ–¥ Previous Projects
- QuickYelp: An AI chatbot that scans the reviews of a given Yelp business and answers questions based on the information gathered.
- ZotPlanner: A UCI course search engine and a prerequisite verifier that generates the correct order to take a given set of classes.
- Minesweeper Lab: A spin-off of the original Minesweeper puzzle game, built with extra game modes designed to improve the users' pattern recognition skills.
